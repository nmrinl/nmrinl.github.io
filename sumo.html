<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p>This paper introduces a novel stick-breaking
process namely ordered stick-breaking process
(OSBP), where the atoms appear in order. The
choice of weights on atoms of OSBP ensure two
important things; (1)that probability of adding
new atoms exponentially decrease with time and
(2)OSBP, though non-exchangeable, admits pre-
dictive probability functions (PPFs). We apply
OSBP to Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models
and find that in a sequential setting where data
is arriving in mini-batches OSBP forms a natu-
ral prior over mini-batches, facilitating exchange
of relevant statistical information across mini-
batches by sharing the atoms of OSBP. One of
the major contributions of this paper is SUMO,
an MCMC algorithm, for solving the inference
problem arising from applying OSBP to BNP
models. SUMO uses the PPFs of OSBP to ob-
tain a Gibbs-sampling based truncation-free al-
gorithm which applies generally to BNP mod-
els. For large scale inference problems exist-
ing algorithms such as Particle Filtering(PF) are
not practical and variational procedures such as
TSVI(Wang &amp; Blei, 2012) are the only alterna-
tive. SUMO is thus an important addition to
MCMC family which works well empirically.
For Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM),
SUMO outperforms TSVI (Wang &amp; Blei, 2012)
on perplexity by 33% on 3 datasets with million
data points, which are beyond the scope of PF,
using only 3GB RAM.</p>
