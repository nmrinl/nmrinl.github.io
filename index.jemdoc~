+PhD Thesis+: Extensions and Applications of Stick-Breaking Process on Topic Models.



== Research Interests

My fascination is to develop simple and novel mathematical models to address interesting and challenging practical problems. 
#During my PhD I have focused on text datasets, they are ubiquitous and possess some interesting challenges requiring novel techniques. 
Broadly, I am interested in

#- Designing hierarchical Bayesian models for text datasets (mono-lingual as well as multi-lingual), information retrieval and extraction.

- Topic models and Bayesian nonparametric models for practical problems.

- Differentially private Bayesian models

I am proficient and experienced in using both variational approximation as well as MCMC based inference for topic models. I like to explore different areas of application and in recent past I have worked with various types of text datasets like software projects, speech transcripts, multi-lingual corpora, news/blogs and comments. I have observed some challenging problems associated with these applications and developed novel mathematical models to solve them.

Privacy has become important after digitization of each and every information which can be personal, private or public. My interest is to explore, if it is possible to utilize the provable privacy guarantees of differential privacy within Bayesian framework despite maintaining accuracy. Specially in the field of personalized medicine, privacy protection has become mandatory due to sensitive genomic information. Similar privacy issues are prevalent in social media, advertisements and recommendation systems.  

== Research Achievements
#== Overview of my recent work

Topic models are popular mathematical tools for analysing text datasets, where a corpus is a collection of documents. The state of art notion in topic models was to use +single topic vector+ per document.
I conceived the novel yet simple idea of using +multiple topic vectors+ (MTV). We have observed phenomenal ability of MTV in (i) discovering subtle topics, (ii) modeling specific correspondence, (iii) modeling multi-glyphic topical correspondence, (iv) content driven user profiling for comment-worthy recommendations. All of them helped in inventing novel models (i) [http://mllab.csa.iisc.ernet.in/stm/ subtle topic models (STM, in ICML, 2013)], (ii) [http://mllab.csa.iisc.ernet.in/sctm/ specific correspondence topic models (SCTM, in WSDM, 2014)], (iii) [http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI15/paper/view/9503 multi-glyphic correspondence topic model (AAAI, 2015)], (iv) collaborative correspondence topic models (CCTM in RecSys, 2015).

I have also worked on Bayesian nonparametric models for learning very large scale (more than 8 million documents and 700 million tokens) datasets. There is /NO/  method known using MCMC for such scale without using expensive parallel hardware. The work has been accepted at ICML, 2015.

#I have invented a novel Bayesian nonparametric prior and used the concept of MTV across documents to apply MCMC. We have observed significant results.

Recently at Aalto university, we have been able to solve the problem of predicting drug sensitivity using gene expressions even after preserving privacy. I have conceived the novel concept of +projecting outliers to tighter bounds without affecting non-outliers+  which has been the key in our method.
# to rank cell lines using private information which is comparable with non-private models and there is no other solution.
